    <p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Roanne Christine, a 20 year old born on October 2, 2003. I may be 4'11", but I promise I bring a lot of energy to the table. I live in Alabang Muntinlupa City. My hobbies are building puzzle, any kinds of puzzle will do, watching series and anime, playing mobile games and working. Talking about my knowledge in computer language, I rate myself 8/10 in java, I studied java 2yrs in senior high that's why. While on other languages I think 5/10. except c++ since it is almost like java. So I'm rooting from this subject/teacher to help me.</p>
